# Pipeline

This folder should contain all code, documentation and resources required for the pipeline.

With terminal inside the pipeline directory: 

    Creation:
        * Full pipeline to the cloud: ./create_pipeline.sh
        * Full pipeline locally: ./create_pipeline_local.sh

    Running Existing Pipeline:
        * Cloud pipeline: ./run_pipeline.sh
        * Local pipeline: ./run_pipeline_local.sh

    Note: May need to adjust permissions on your device to make scripts runnable:
        * chmod +x ./create_pipeline.sh
        * chmod +x ./create_pipeline_local.sh
        * chmod +x ./run_pipeline.sh
        * chmod +x ./run_pipeline_local.sh
